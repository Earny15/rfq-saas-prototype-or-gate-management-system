# Smart Dock Assignment & Persistent Vehicle Management Test

## ✅ **New Features Implemented:**

### 1. **Persistent Vehicle Display**
- ✅ Completed vehicles remain in dock management with green "Completed" status
- ✅ Vehicles show throughout entire lifecycle: loading → completed → gate out → final completion
- ✅ Visual distinction between ongoing (orange) and completed (green) vehicles

### 2. **Smart Dock Assignment**
- ✅ System automatically assigns vehicles to available docks
- ✅ Prevents multiple vehicles from being assigned to occupied docks
- ✅ Fallback to random assignment if all docks are occupied
- ✅ Console logging shows occupied vs. available docks

### 3. **Enhanced Visual Indicators**
- ✅ Dock tabs show vehicle count: "DOCK 1 (2)"
- ✅ Color-coded status indicators: Orange dot = Ongoing, Green dot = Completed
- ✅ Status legend for easy understanding
- ✅ Real-time updates as vehicles progress through workflow

## 🧪 **Comprehensive Test Workflow:**

### Phase 1: Test Smart Dock Assignment
1. **Navigate to**: http://localhost:3000/gate-management
2. **Click "RESET DATA"** to start fresh
3. **Start Vehicle A**:
   - Pick first "NOT STARTED" vehicle
   - Complete: Gate In → Tare Weight → Loading Info → Start Loading
   - **Check assignment**: Should get "Dock 1" (first available)
   - **Verify dock management**: Vehicle appears in Dock 1

4. **Start Vehicle B** (immediately after):
   - Pick second "NOT STARTED" vehicle
   - Complete: Gate In → Tare Weight → Loading Info → Start Loading
   - **Check assignment**: Should get "Dock 2" (next available)
   - **Verify dock management**: Vehicle appears in Dock 2

5. **Continue with Vehicles C, D, E**:
   - Each should get assigned to next available dock (Dock 3, 4, 5)
   - **Check dock tabs**: Should show counts like "DOCK 1 (1)", "DOCK 2 (1)", etc.

### Phase 2: Test Vehicle Persistence
1. **Complete checklist for Vehicle A**:
   - Navigate to dock management
   - Click Vehicle A in Dock 1
   - Complete all required checklist items
   - Click "FINISH LOADING"
   - **Verify**: Vehicle A status changes to green "Completed"
   - **Check dock tab**: Dock 1 should show green dot (completed)

2. **Return to gate management**:
   - Vehicle A should show green "CAPTURE GROSS WEIGHT" button
   - Complete gross weight → gate out → completed

3. **Check dock management again**:
   - **Verify**: Vehicle A still appears in Dock 1 with "Completed" status
   - **Check**: Clicking Vehicle A shows read-only completed checklist

### Phase 3: Test Mixed States
1. **Create mixed scenario**:
   - Vehicle A: Completed (green in dock)
   - Vehicle B: Still loading (orange in dock)
   - Vehicle C: Just started loading (orange in dock)

2. **Verify dock tabs**:
   - Docks with ongoing vehicles: Orange dot + count
   - Docks with only completed: Green dot + count
   - Empty docks: No indicator

3. **Test new vehicle assignment**:
   - Start Vehicle F
   - **Should avoid**: Docks 1, 2, 3 (occupied by ongoing vehicles)
   - **Should assign**: First available dock or random if all occupied

## 🎯 **Expected Console Logs:**

When starting a new vehicle loading, watch for:
```
Occupied docks: ["Dock 1", "Dock 2", "Dock 3"]
Available docks: ["Dock 4", "Dock 5"]
```

## 📊 **Visual Verification:**

### Dock Tabs Should Show:
- **Empty Dock**: "DOCK 5" (no indicator)
- **Dock with Ongoing**: "DOCK 1 🟠 (1)" 
- **Dock with Completed**: "DOCK 2 🟢 (1)"
- **Mixed Dock**: "DOCK 3 🟠 (2)" (if has any ongoing)

### Status Legend:
- 🟠 Ongoing = Vehicle currently loading
- 🟢 Completed = Vehicle finished loading

### Vehicle Cards:
- **Ongoing**: Orange "Ongoing" chip, editable checklist
- **Completed**: Green "Completed" chip, read-only checklist

## 🔍 **Advanced Test Scenarios:**

### Scenario 1: All Docks Occupied
1. Start 5 vehicles to fill all docks
2. Start 6th vehicle
3. **Expected**: Gets assigned to random dock (with warning in console)

### Scenario 2: Vehicle Progression
1. Vehicle starts: Shows in dock as "Ongoing"
2. Complete checklist: Changes to "Completed" (stays in dock)
3. Complete gate out: Still shows as "Completed" in dock
4. **Persistent audit trail**: Always visible for review

### Scenario 3: Page Refresh
1. Have vehicles in various states
2. Refresh dock management page
3. **Expected**: All vehicles persist with correct statuses

## 🚨 **Success Criteria:**

- [ ] New vehicles avoid occupied docks
- [ ] Completed vehicles remain visible in dock management
- [ ] Dock tabs show accurate count and status indicators
- [ ] Console logs show available/occupied dock logic
- [ ] Mixed states (ongoing + completed) display correctly
- [ ] Smart assignment works with up to 5 concurrent vehicles
