# Gate Management Workflow Test

## Fixed Issues:

1. **License Verification Section Visibility**
   - Changed condition from `{scannedPlate && gateInTime && (` to `{(scannedPlate || vehicleNumber) && gateInTime && (`
   - Now appears after either camera scan OR manual vehicle entry

2. **License Input Accessibility** 
   - Enhanced styling with `border-2 border-blue-200 focus:border-blue-500`
   - Improved placeholder text: "Enter license number (e.g., DL123456789)"
   - Added icon to verification button

3. **Complete Process Button**
   - Fixed condition: `disabled={!(scannedPlate || vehicleNumber) || !gateInTime || !driverVerified}`
   - Updated function to use `finalVehicleNumber = scannedPlate || vehicleNumber`
   - Enhanced success messaging

## Test Steps:

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3002/gate-management
2. Click "CAMERA SCAN & GATE IN" on any "NOT STARTED" card
3. Either:
   - Use "Start Plate Scanning" (simulates camera scan)
   - OR manually enter vehicle number in "Enter Vehicle Number Manually" field
4. License verification section should appear automatically
5. Enter license number (e.g., DL123456789)
6. Click "Verify License with Saarathi" 
7. Wait for verification to complete
8. Click "Complete Gate-In Process"
9. Card should move to "In Progress" tab with next action button

## Expected Result:
- Smooth workflow progression from start to finish
- All input fields accessible and functional
- Proper state transitions between workflow steps
