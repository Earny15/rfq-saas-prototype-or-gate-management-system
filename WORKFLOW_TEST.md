# Complete Gate Management & Dock Management Integration Test

## üöÄ Application URLs:
- **Gate Management**: http://localhost:3000/gate-management  
- **Dock Management**: http://localhost:3000/dock-management

## üîÑ Complete Workflow Test Steps:

### Phase 1: Gate Management (Vehicle Entry)
1. Navigate to **Gate Management** page
2. Find a vehicle with status **"NOT STARTED"**
3. Click **"GATE IN"** button
4. Complete the gate-in process (camera scan or manual entry + license verification)
5. Vehicle status changes to **"GATE IN"**

### Phase 2: Tare Weight Capture
1. Click **"CAPTURE TARE WEIGHT"** button
2. Complete the weighbridge simulation (4 seconds)
3. Vehicle status changes to **"TARE WEIGHT CAPTURED"**

### Phase 3: Loading Info Entry
1. Click **"CAPTURE LOADING INFO"** button
2. Fill in:
   - Loading Incharge name (e.g., "Supervisor A")
   - Loading items description
3. Click **"Start Loading"**
4. Vehicle status changes to **"LOADING IN DOCK"**
5. Vehicle is automatically assigned to a dock

### Phase 4: Dock Management (Steel Loading Checklist)
1. **Switch to Dock Management** page
2. The same vehicle should now appear in the assigned dock with:
   - Orange pulsing indicator: "Steel Loading"
   - Vehicle details matching gate management
3. **Click on the vehicle** in the dock to open loading checklist
4. Complete the **Steel Manufacturing Loading Checklist**:
   - Safety Checks (4 items - all required)
   - Vehicle Inspection (4 items - 3 required)
   - Material Preparation (4 items - 3 required)
   - Loading Equipment (4 items - 3 required)
   - Documentation (4 items - 3 required)
   - Final Checks (4 items - all required)
5. Complete all **required items** (marked with red "Required" badge)
6. Click **"FINISH LOADING"** button
7. Vehicle status changes to **"LOADING"**

### Phase 5: Return to Gate Management (Gross Weight)
1. **Switch back to Gate Management** page
2. The vehicle should now show:
   - Status: **"LOADING"**
   - Button: **"CAPTURE GROSS WEIGHT"** (green)
   - Badge: **"Loading Complete"**
3. Click **"CAPTURE GROSS WEIGHT"** button
4. Complete weighbridge simulation (4 seconds)
5. Vehicle status changes to **"GROSS WEIGHT CAPTURED"**

### Phase 6: Gate Out
1. Click **"CAPTURE GATE OUT"** button
2. Complete gate out process
3. Vehicle status changes to **"COMPLETED"**

## ‚úÖ Expected Results:

### Cross-System Integration:
- **Real-time sync**: Changes in dock management reflect in gate management within 2-3 seconds
- **Same vehicle**: Exact same vehicle appears in both systems (not mock data)
- **Status blocking**: Cannot capture gross weight until dock loading is complete
- **Visual indicators**: Clear status updates and loading indicators

### Data Persistence:
- Vehicle data persists across page refreshes
- Status changes are maintained between systems
- Loading progress is tracked and saved

### User Experience:
- Clear visual feedback for each step
- Blocked actions show appropriate error messages
- Loading states and progress indicators
- Consistent button styling and interactions

## üêõ Testing Multiple Vehicles:
Repeat this workflow with multiple vehicles to ensure:
- Each vehicle maintains its own state
- No cross-contamination between vehicles
- Dock assignments work correctly
- Multiple vehicles can be in different stages simultaneously

## üì± Mobile Testing:
Test the workflow on mobile devices to ensure:
- Responsive design works across systems
- Touch interactions function properly
- Modals and drawers display correctly
