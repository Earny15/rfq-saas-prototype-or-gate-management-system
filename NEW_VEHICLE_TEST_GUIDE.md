## ðŸ§ª **Complete End-to-End Testing Workflow:**

### Phase 1: Setup Fresh Environment
1. **Navigate to**: http://localhost:3000/gate-management
2. **Click "RESET DATA"** to start with clean slate
3. **Verify**: Only original mock vehicles are visible

### Phase 2: Test Smart Dock Assignment with New Vehicles
1. **Add Vehicle A**: Click "QUICK ADD" 
   - **Result**: New vehicle appears at top with "NOT STARTED" status
   - **Note**: Vehicle number will be TEST#### format

2. **Start Vehicle A Workflow**:
   - Click "GATE IN" â†’ Complete gate-in process
   - Click "CAPTURE TARE WEIGHT" â†’ Complete weighing
   - Click "CAPTURE LOADING INFO" â†’ Fill details â†’ "Start Loading"
   - **Check assignment**: Should get "Dock 1" (first available)
   - **Console log**: "Available docks: ['Dock 1', 'Dock 2', 'Dock 3', 'Dock 4', 'Dock 5']"

3. **Add Vehicle B**: Click "QUICK ADD" again
   - **Start workflow for Vehicle B** (same steps)
   - **Check assignment**: Should get "Dock 2" (avoiding occupied Dock 1)
   - **Console log**: "Occupied docks: ['Dock 1'], Available docks: ['Dock 2', 'Dock 3', 'Dock 4', 'Dock 5']"

4. **Continue adding Vehicles C, D, E**:
   - Each should get next available dock
   - Watch dock assignment logic in console

### Phase 3: Test Manual Vehicle Creation
1. **Click "ADD VEHICLE"** to open detailed form
2. **Fill in custom details**:
   ```
   Vehicle No: MH12XY9876
   Driver Name: Amit Sharma
   Driver Phone: 9887766554
   Transporter: Custom Transport Ltd
   Origin: Pune
   Destination: Nashik
   ```
3. **Click "Add Vehicle"** 
4. **Verify**: Custom vehicle appears with exact details entered

### Phase 4: Test Complete Workflow with New Vehicles
1. **Navigate to Dock Management**: http://localhost:3000/dock-management
2. **Verify dock display**:
   - Dock 1: Shows Vehicle A with "Ongoing" status
   - Dock 2: Shows Vehicle B with "Ongoing" status
   - Dock tabs show counts: "DOCK 1 ðŸŸ  (1)", "DOCK 2 ðŸŸ  (1)"

3. **Complete Vehicle A checklist**:
   - Click Vehicle A in Dock 1
   - Complete all required checklist items
   - Click "FINISH LOADING"
   - **Verify**: Vehicle A status changes to "Completed" (green)
   - **Check dock tab**: Dock 1 shows green dot

4. **Test persistence**:
   - Vehicle A remains in Dock 1 with "Completed" status
   - Clicking Vehicle A shows read-only completed checklist

### Phase 5: Test Advanced Scenarios

#### Scenario A: Fill All Docks
1. **Create 5 vehicles using "QUICK ADD"**
2. **Start all 5 vehicles through to loading**
3. **Verify**: Each gets assigned to different dock (1-5)
4. **Add 6th vehicle and start workflow**
5. **Expected**: Gets random dock assignment (all occupied)
6. **Console**: Should show "All docks occupied, assigning randomly"

#### Scenario B: Mixed Vehicle States
1. **Have vehicles in different states**:
   - Vehicle A: Completed loading (green in dock)
   - Vehicle B: Still loading (orange in dock)
   - Vehicle C: Just started loading (orange in dock)
   - Vehicle D: Not yet started

2. **Add new Vehicle E**:
   - Should avoid docks with ongoing vehicles (B, C)
   - Could potentially use dock with completed vehicle (A)

#### Scenario C: Complete Vehicle Lifecycle
1. **Track one vehicle from creation to completion**:
   - Create â†’ Gate In â†’ Tare Weight â†’ Loading â†’ Dock Checklist â†’ Gross Weight â†’ Gate Out â†’ Completed
2. **Verify dock persistence**: Vehicle remains visible throughout entire lifecycle
